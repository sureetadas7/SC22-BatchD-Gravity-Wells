Pandas is an awesome module that helps us deal with large amounts of data in an easy to understand way. Below we will look at some of its many functions\n\nFirst, we'll have to import it. It is common practice to \\`import pandas as pd\\` but you are free to import it as you see fit.\n","pos":84,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"88030a","input":"Functions act like variables but instead of storing a value, they store lines of code. Below we can see how a function is created and used.","pos":55,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8c4c7e","input":"Finnally, functions can have a \"return\" statement. This is what the function sends back to the place it was called. You can think of functions like black boxes where the parameters in the parentheses are the input and the return statement is the output. This output can be saved to a variable to be used later. We will redefine the add_numbers function from above using a return statement to show this off.","pos":62,"type":"cell"}
{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8cbbef","input":"Whenever the computer sees the function being used, it automatically runs the code stored inside of that function.","pos":58,"type":"cell"}

{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8e2fb6","input":"### Numpy \\- For Scientific Computing in Python\n\nBelow, we will import the numpy module and use a few of its functions to show off this power. Numpy is a library which is coded outside of python, making it faster. It gives us access to better and more efficient lists\n\nFor any module you encounter, you should be prepared to <u>read the docs.</u> The \"docs\" are how we can learn to use each module, and you can find Numpy's here: [https://numpy.org/. ](https://numpy.org/)\n\n**For using modules, you'll want to import them like so below.**\n\n","pos":73,"type":"cell"}

In general, you can make a while loop do anything that a for loop can do but with slightly different syntax, so if you find youself understanding while loops better than for loops, you can just focus on using while loops.
